Log analysis:

Log analysis is the process of analysing the computer/machine generated data
	
	collection of data --> extraction of data --> convert into structured form --> analyse the data --> obtain the results

Need for log analysis:

	-->Issue Debugging:

		whenever we came across an issue in production scenario, in order to debug the issue we read the logs, it helps us to debug the issue

	-->Predictive Analysis:

		reading of logs in regular intervals we can reduce the occurence of certain issues or errors is a predictive analysis eg: if we findout 
earlier some issue which'll breakdown the server

	-->Security Analysis:

		if there's any attack going on u r application those kinda things are captured in logs eg:DDos attack, penetration attack
		
	-->Performance analysis:
   		
		logs help us to analyse the performance of app as well such as whether it's performing good or had it slowed down

	-->Internet of things& Debugging:

		it's related to app pov, if an app taking data from an external server and performing an action

ElasticSearch:
	
	Elasticsearch is a real-time, distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. It can be used for many purposes, but one context where it excels 
is indexing streams of semi-structured data, such as logs

Kibana:

	Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with
data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.

Beats:

	Open Source data shippers to send operational data to Elasticsearch

Fluentd:

	Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.

	Fluentd is a popular open-source data collector that we'll set up on our Kubernetes nodes to tail container log files, filter and transform the 
log data, and deliver it to the Elasticsearch cluster, where it will be indexed and stored.
